# Ads Engine

AI-powered ad management platform with human-in-the-loop approval.
Claude AI suggests actions. You approve. System executes. No money moves without your ✅.

---

## What It Does

- Manages Meta and Google ad campaigns across multiple clients from one dashboard
- AI analyzes performance and suggests optimizations (pause bad ad sets, increase budgets, write copy)
- Every spend-affecting action goes into an **approval queue** — you approve or reject before anything runs
- Real-time dashboard with spend, CPC, clicks, and AI insights per client

| **Tier 2 — Approve** | You (or Manager) | Create campaign, change budget, pause ad set, edit copy |
| **Tier 3 — Restricted** | Admin only | Delete campaigns, remove accounts, override caps |

- [x] `requirements.txt` — all Python dependencies pinned
- [x] `.env.example` — all secrets documented (Meta, Google, Claude, WhatsApp)
- [x] `config/settings.yaml` — app config (CORS, scheduler, AI model)
- [x] `config/safety.yaml` — spend limits, anomaly rules, Tier 3 restrictions
- [x] `config/clients/tickets99.yaml` — first client config
- [x] `ads_engine/models/base.py` — all Pydantic models (Campaign, AdSet, Ad, Targeting, PerformanceReport...)
- [x] `ads_engine/platforms/base.py` — abstract platform adapter interface with Tier 1/2/3 annotations
- [x] `ads_engine/core/config.py` — settings loader (env + YAML, cached)
- [x] `main.py` — FastAPI app with CORS, lifespan, /health endpoint
- [x] Frontend scaffold — Next.js 15, Tailwind, all page routes stubbed
- [x] `frontend/next.config.ts` — API proxy to FastAPI backend
- [x] `frontend/postcss.config.mjs` — required for Tailwind CSS to compile
- [x] `frontend/app/clients/page.tsx` — clients page stub (was in architecture, missing from initial build)

#### Audit Log (2026-03-12) — Initial build + post-audit fixes
| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Bug 1 | `config.py` ROOT path `parents[3]` → project root, YAML files would not load | Fixed to `parents[2]` → `backend/` |
| Bug 2 | `httpx` duplicated in `requirements.txt` | Removed duplicate |
| Bug 3 | Unused imports (`os`, `field_validator`) in `config.py` | Removed |
| Missing 1 | `frontend/app/clients/page.tsx` missing from initial build | Added |
| Missing 2 | `frontend/postcss.config.mjs` missing — Tailwind would not compile | Added |

#### Cross-phase audit (2026-03-12) — All phases reviewed together
| # | Issue | File | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bug 4 | `datetime.utcnow()` deprecated in Python 3.12 (1 occurrence) | `models/base.py` | Replaced with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` |

#### Audit Log (2026-03-12)
> Full file-by-file review conducted after initial build. 3 bugs found and fixed, 2 missing files added.

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Bug 1 | `config.py` ROOT path used `parents[3]` → pointed to project root, config files would not load at runtime | Fixed to `parents[2]` → resolves to `backend/` correctly (verified) |
| Bug 2 | `httpx` listed twice in `requirements.txt` | Removed duplicate |
| Bug 3 | Unused imports in `config.py` (`import os`, `from pydantic import field_validator`) | Removed |
| Missing 1 | `frontend/app/clients/page.tsx` listed in architecture nav but not created | Added |
| Missing 2 | `frontend/postcss.config.mjs` required for Tailwind CSS compilation — `npm run dev` would fail without it | Added |

- [x] `GET /api/v1/clients/{id}` — client detail (403 if wrong manager)
- [x] `GET /api/v1/approvals` — pending actions (scoped by role/client)
- [x] `GET /api/v1/approvals/all` — all actions with optional `?status=` filter
- [x] `GET /api/v1/approvals/{id}` — single action detail
- [x] `POST /api/v1/approvals/{id}/approve` — approve action (manager/admin only)

#### Audit Log (2026-03-12) — Phase 4 build + fixes
| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Bug 10 | `passlib` + `bcrypt` version incompatibility — bcrypt's 72-byte self-test fails at import, crashing all tests | Switched from `bcrypt` to `sha256_crypt`; pre-computed hashes stored as string literals |
| Bug 11 | `deps.py` imported `approval_queue` at module load (captured `None`); reassignment in `init_queue()` was invisible to the dep function | Changed to access `_queue_module.approval_queue` live via module reference |
| Bug 12 | WebSocket route registered under `/api/v1` prefix → endpoint was at `/api/v1/ws` instead of `/ws` | Moved WebSocket router to app-level in `main.py` (no version prefix) |
| Bug 13 | `lifespan` always called `init_queue()` at startup, overwriting the test fixture's queue with a fresh empty one | Added guard: skip `init_queue()` if queue already initialised |

- [x] `ads_engine/ai/chat.py` — `ChatSession` with stateful message history. Natural language → `PendingAction` via structured JSON. Auto-queues tier 2/3 actions for human approval.
- [x] `ads_engine/ai/analyst.py` — `analyze_performance()` takes PerformanceReports and returns structured insights (winners, underperformers, anomalies, recommended_actions)
- [x] `ads_engine/ai/optimizer.py` — `suggest_optimizations()` proposes budget shifts and audience changes as `list[PendingAction]`

- [x] All suggestions route through approval queue — Claude never executes directly
- [x] Tier routing: AI suggestions become Tier 1 (auto), Tier 2 (approve), or Tier 3 (admin) based on action type
- [x] Graceful fallback: non-JSON Claude responses don't crash — return empty action list
- [x] `tests/test_ai.py` — 33 tests covering all AI modules + endpoints, zero real API calls (all mocked)

#### Audit Log (2026-03-12) — Phase 5 build + fixes
| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Bug 14 | `_build_pending_action` did `.upper()` on action type but `ActionType` values are lowercase | Changed to `.lower()` — now accepts both `"PAUSE_ADSET"` and `"pause_adset"` from Claude |
| Bug 15 | `PendingAction.tier1()` called with `reason`/`estimated_impact` kwargs it doesn't accept | Tier 1 factory called with only the 5 params it expects |
| Bug 16 | `Platform.TIKTOK` exists — `"tiktok"` is a valid platform, test used wrong invalid value | Changed bad-platform test to `"facebook"` |
| Bug 17 | Test fixtures for `Campaign`, `AdSet`, `PerformanceReport` missing required fields (`client_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `entity_type`, `date_from`, `date_to`) | All fixture helpers updated |

#### Test Results (2026-03-12) — 121 passing, 0 failing, 0 warnings
